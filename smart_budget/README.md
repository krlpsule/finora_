#Finora (Finance + Aurora)
1. Project Overview

Finora is a mobile finance management application designed to help users track their income and expenses, analyze their spending habits, and receive personalized financial recommendations. 
By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), the application not only assists users with financial advice but also enables navigation within the app through natural language and voice commands. 
The system aims to simplify financial planning by combining smart technology with an intuitive, youth-friendly user interface.

2. Objectives
   
•	Allow users to record and categorize daily income and expenses.
•	Provide AI-powered personalized financial advice based on past data.
•	Enable voice commands (speech-to-text) for faster and more accessible navigation.
•	Display financial summaries and charts for better visualization.
•	Send daily and weekly notifications to remind users to log expenses.
•	Share daily motivational financial quotes through notifications.
•	Ensure secure and reliable data storage.

3.	Speech-to-Text Integration:
Converts user’s spoken input into text using Google Speech-to-Text API, making the app more accessible and interactive.
4.	Notifications:
Sends daily reminders to add expenses, alerts when the monthly budget limit is about to be reached, and shares motivational financial quotes daily to encourage smarter money habits.
